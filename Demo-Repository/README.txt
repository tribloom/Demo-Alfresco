It is standard in Ant based Java projects to provide a build.properties.sample
file. This file should server as an example of how to create a build.properties
file so that the project will build correctly. Normally this is a matter of
setting directory paths according to your personal development environment.

To deploy without AMP:

1. Make sure build.properties reflects the appropriate file paths.
2. Run "ant deploy".

To deploy as an AMP:

1. Make sure build.properties reflects the appropriate file paths.
2. Copy the alfresco.war to the client-extensions/build directory if it isn't
   there already.
3. Run "ant deploy-amp -Dalfresco.war.path=[path to your workspace]/client-extensions/build/alfresco.war".
